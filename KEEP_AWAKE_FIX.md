# 🔧 Keep-Awake Fix - Issue Resolved

## ❌ **Problem**

```
TypeError: deactivateKeepAwakeAsync is not a function (it is undefined)
```

## ✅ **Solution**

Fixed the expo-keep-awake API usage and centralized keep-awake functionality.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Fixed API Usage**

- **Before**: `import { activateKeepAwakeAsync, deactivateKeepAwakeAsync }`
- **After**: `import * as KeepAwake from 'expo-keep-awake'`
- **Fixed**: Used correct functions: `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwakeAsync()` and `KeepAwake.deactivateKeepAwake()`

### **2. Centralized Keep-Awake Logic**

- **Moved from**: `DigitalClock.js` component
- **Moved to**: `ClockComponent.js` (parent component)
- **Benefit**: Now works consistently across all clock types (Digital, Analog, World)

### **3. Improved Architecture**

```javascript
// ClockComponent.js - Centralized keep-awake
useEffect(() => {
  if (settings.keepAwake) {
    KeepAwake.activateKeepAwakeAsync();
  }

  return () => {
    if (settings.keepAwake) {
      KeepAwake.deactivateKeepAwake();
    }
  };
}, [settings.keepAwake]);
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **✅ Error Fixed**

- No more `deactivateKeepAwakeAsync is not a function` error
- App loads and runs without crashes

### **🔄 Better Functionality**

- Keep-awake now works for **all clock types** (Digital, Analog, World Clock)
- Settings toggle affects all clock screens consistently
- Proper cleanup when component unmounts

### **🏗️ Cleaner Code**

- Keep-awake logic centralized in one place
- No duplication across different clock components
- Easier to maintain and debug

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Verify Keep-Awake Works**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Clock Settings**
2. Toggle **Keep Screen Awake** ON
3. Switch between different clock types (Digital/Analog/World)
4. Screen should stay awake on all clock types
5. Toggle OFF → Screen should follow normal timeout

### **Test Clock Switching**

1. Try switching between Digital → Analog → World Clock
2. No errors should occur
3. Keep-awake setting should persist across all types

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**

The app should now:

- ✅ Load without keep-awake errors
- ✅ Keep screen awake when setting is enabled
- ✅ Work consistently across all clock types
- ✅ Properly clean up when switching screens

The unified clock system is now fully functional! 🚀
